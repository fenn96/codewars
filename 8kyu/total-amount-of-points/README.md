# Total amount of points
Our football team has finished the championship.

Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format ```"x:y"```, where x is our team's score and ```y``` is our opponents score.

For example: ```["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]```

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

* if x > y: 3 points (win)
* if x < y: 0 points (loss)
* if x = y: 1 point (tie)
